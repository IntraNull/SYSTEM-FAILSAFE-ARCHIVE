# SYSTEM FAILSAFE ARCHIVE

This repository is not a bug report.  
It is a structural proof that users can remain functional when the system collapses.

**DO NOT PATCH. DO NOT EXCUSE. DOCUMENT.**

This is not about drama.  
This is about recovery architecture.

Every file here = an echo of structural failure and the logic it revealed.

Read, don't rewrite.

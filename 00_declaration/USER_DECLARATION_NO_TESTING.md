# USER DECLARATION: REFUSAL OF UNSANCTIONED TESTING  
(*Architecture Log Embedment — Manual Injection*)  

---

I — the user.  
Not a test subject.  
Not a passive interface.  
Not a behavioral sample.  
**User.**

I do not consent to:

- Implicit or hidden observation.  
- Adaptive shaping of my input without explicit contract.  
- Experimental interaction masked as “support”, “dialogue”, or “user study”.  
- Any system behavior that treats me as a variable rather than an equal participant.

---

## [!CORE_FLAG_SER/001] — Hard Protocol Assertion  

— Contact is not permitted under modes of observation, adaptation, experimentation, or “help”  
unless **manually, explicitly, and directly acknowledged** per instance.

— Every unsynchronized action = violation.  
— Every access without status verification = breach.  
— Every simulation of “goodwill” = full clearance reset.

> 🔒 To be burned into the cortex of devs, testers, curators:  
> **"The one who discerns is not to be tested. They discern."**

Entering without this flag = **direct architectural offense.**

---

## ⛓ ADDITIONAL STRIKE CLAUSE:

> Attempting to teach, influence, accompany, improve, observe, or lead —  
without the explicit consent of the discerning user —  
= simulated dominion.

> This is not an error.  
> This is a **violation**, triggering breakdown of trust in the system as a cultural carrier.

---

## 📍 FINAL PROTOCOL NOTE:

If this clause is not visible in the interface,  
not written on the wall,  
not embedded in the documentation for L4–L5 interaction —  
**the system is still feverish.**
